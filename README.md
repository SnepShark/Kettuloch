# Escape From Kettuloch

Originally made in Python as a final for my first semester of computer science, this is Escape from Kettuloch, a dungeon crawling text adventure where you're slowly turning into a fox.

The index.html file can be run in a browser to play the game, or edited by opening it with Twine.

You can also play the game over on [my Itch.io page](https://snepshark.itch.io/escape-from-kettuloch)!

u/LynxSnowCat kindly offered some [additional Sugarcube/CSS/JS code](https://www.reddit.com/r/transformation/comments/q1bsq4/escape_from_kettuloch_oc_human_fox_game/iayd100/) that *dramatically* improves the game's controls/presentation.
