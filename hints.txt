Hints!

Gameplay hints for both verisons:
* Use your potions! 50 health is not enough to make it through every combat encounter.

* If you need more hints for the puzzles than what is included in the game (hints are given out when you repeatedly fail a puzzle), look at the solutions in the walkthrough file.

* Stay observant! If the map is not displayed in a room, there is still more to find there.

* Some backtracking is required! Look for rooms that mention locks, and use your map to spot hidden rooms.

* SUPER. HOT. Time only moves when you move (or fail to solve a puzzle).



Pyhton version exclusive hints:
*The targets of your attacks need their names typed exactly as they are spelled. Capitalization doesn't matter, but you *do* need to spell correctly.

* Items need to be equipped! You won't always be able to use every item (paws make it hard to use a some things), but whenever you get something new, use it.

* Use the shortcuts! N, S, E, W, and I are very useful.

* Use the help menu! While there *are* some commands that aren't included there, everything that's mandatory to progress is mentioned in it.

* Bored of combat/puzzles? Check the walkthrough for cheats.

* Want a moderately obscure reference to a Scottish comedy program? Try using "whence I came" as the direction you want to go. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdQ11fTRpCg
